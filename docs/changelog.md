## Release v0.0.1 

### 💫 Highlights
* also probably should have been published to TestPyPI 🤦♂️

### 🚀 Features

* Added a Makefile for streamlining development, publishing, and doc building.
* Added license notifications to all files.


### 📖 Documentation

* Used `Jupyter-Book` structure, with a table of contents (_toc.yml) and various markdown files.
* added `Sphinx.autodoc` to automatically include API documentation.


### ⛔ Maintenance

* Looks of issues with the Poetry -> Jupyter-Books -> Read the Docs workflow
* Poetry / RTD don't like `PyGMT` or `GeoPandas` since they both rely on C packages which can't be installed via pip (`GMT` and `GDAL`). Next release should fix this.

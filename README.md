## Disclaimer

ðŸš¨ **This package is in early stages of design and implementation.** ðŸš¨

I welcome any feedback, idea, or contributions! Please submit an 
`issue on Github <https://github.com/mdtanker/antarctic_plots/issues>` for problems or feature ideas. 

## About

The python package provides some basic tools for create maps and plots specific to Antarctic. It includes code to download common continent-wide datasets (i.e. Bedmap2), and visualize them in a variety of ways, including cross sections and maps. The Jupyter notebook examples/examples.ipynb runs through some of the main functions and usages of this package.

By default the cross-sections include Bedmap2 surface, icebase, and bed as layers, and the data profiles include Free-air gravity and magnetics, but these can be changed to any data, as long as it's supplied as a grid/raster type of file.

Data are sampled along lines either defined by 2 sets of coordinates, or along the path of a shapefile. 

Feel free to use, share, modify, and contribute to this project. I've mostly made this for private usage so documentation is sparse. It is in early stages of developement and design. 

## Getting started

To install the development version from Github:

    pip install https://github.com/mdtanker/antarctic_plots.git

## About

This python package provides some basic tools for creating maps and plots specific to Antarctica. Check out our [Documentation](https://antarctic-plots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for instructions on installing and using the package.

Feel free to use, share, modify, and contribute to this project. I've mostly made this for personal usage so expect signficant changes and hopefully I'll implement some test's and more Gallery examples soon.
